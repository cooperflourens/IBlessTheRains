# IBlessTheRains
Down in Africa

I made this one night when bored, and finding that IBlessTheRains.com was available. I wanted to brush up on HTML, so I went ahead and made it in 30 minutes or so.

If I come back to this, I plan to:
Make autoplay bypass any restrictions,
Remove control bar from mobile website,
Optimize mobile interface,
Create better landing page

Currently:
Has a cute image of Africa,
Plays song automatically (if manually allowed),
Has the song embedded,
