# IBlessTheRains
Down in Africa

I made this one night when bored, and finding that IBlessTheRains.com was available. I wanted to brush up on HTML, so I went ahead and made it in 30 minutes or so.

I'm trying to tweak it to be up to my standards.

I plan to:
Make autoplay bypass any restrictions
Remove control bar from mobile website
Optimize mobile interface
Create better landing page

Currently:
Has a cute image of Africa
  Link to image below
Plays song automatically (if manually allowed)
Has the song embedded
